# Anagram finder

This tool is the result of an exercise (code kata, coding dojo) for test-driven
development (TDD) for PHP using PHPUnit at Oliver Klee's workshops.

An anagram is pair of two words that consist of exactly the same letters, but
in different order.

Example: anthologise, theologians

## Installation

Run `composer install` to install the required Composer packages.

## How to run it

```bash
bin/FindAnagrams.php
```

## The exercises

1. Create a class that reads a list of words from a file and returns it as an array.
2. Create a class that takes a word and sorts the characters.
3. Create a class that finds and returns the anagram from an array of words.
